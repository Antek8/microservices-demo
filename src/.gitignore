# Go: for the time being we are not checking in the vendor/ directories to git
#This is a test
# to prevent the repo from getting larger forever. In each Go service, you can
# run "dep ensure --vendor-only" to download the dependencies to vendor/ based
# on the Gopkg.{toml,lock} files in that directory.
